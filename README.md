# OneRoom
A game created for Ludum Dare 37 (Theme: One Room)

This game was created over 48 hours alongside Dylan Bowne. 
As a result the code is disorganized, sub-optimal, inefficient, bug-ridden, and genrally terrible.
It's still a pretty neat little game though.

If you're downloading and playing the source here are some general tips (Copied from LD page):


You're trapped in a room, but you still have hope! Take command of a drone through a command line interface and attempt to program it to escape and find help. 
INSTRUCTIONS AND TIPS FOR PLAY (these can also be found in the pause menu): 

- The objective of the game is to navigate the drone just outside your room (shown as a triangle on the map) to the exit to call for help. 

- To begin press E near the computer and type 'help' to get an idea of the commands available to you 

- Use the Command Edit program (opened with cmd_edit filename) to create/edit drone command files. Then use the drone_set command to slot in up to 7 command files to be executed in order when you enter the 'drone_run' command. 

- There's a bug where text is highlighted automatically when opening a command file to edit, be careful not to replace your existing text. 

- To see all drone commands look at the comments in your created command file, or create a new one if you've accidentally written over them. 

- Try using directories to organize your command files 

- Be sure to check the map/log viewer on the wall after every run to pinpoint where the drone went. (hint: there are obstacles and items not shown on the map) 

- Use the scan command often to get an idea of the items/obstacles in the current room 

- Graph paper (physical or digital) might be helpful, but isn't required.
